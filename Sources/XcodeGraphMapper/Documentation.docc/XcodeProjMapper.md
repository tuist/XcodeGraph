A tool that maps Xcode projects (`.xcodeproj` and `.xcworkspace`) into a structured, analyzable graph of projects, targets, dependencies, and build settings. This enables downstream tasks such as code generation, dependency analysis, and integration with custom tooling pipelines.

## Overview

``XcodeGraphMapper`` leverages ``XcodeProj`` to parse and navigate Xcode project files, then translates them into a domain-specific graph model (``XcodeGraph/Graph``). This model captures all essential components—projects, targets, packages, dependencies, build settings, schemes, and more—providing a high-level, language-agnostic structure for further processing.

By using this graph-based representation, you can easily analyze project configurations, visualize complex dependency graphs, or integrate advanced workflows into your build pipelines. For example, teams can leverage ``XcodeGraphMapper`` to:

- Generate code based on discovered resources and targets.
- Validate project configurations and detect missing bundle identifiers or invalid references.
- Explore dependencies between multiple projects and packages within a workspace.
- Automate repetitive tasks like scheme generation, resource synthesis, or compliance checks.
